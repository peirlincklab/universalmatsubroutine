@author:mpeirlinck

This folder contains the universal material subroutine developed in  
"A universal material model subroutine for soft matter systems"  
by M. Peirlinck, J.A. Hurtado, M.K. Rausch, A. Buganza Tepole, and E. Kuhl.  

We also provide a pre-compiled (Windows11-abq2024.hf1-ifort2021.09-vs2019) version of the subroutine for users who do not have the proper compilers installed.  
Copy the abaqus_v6.env file to the working directory in which you launch your simulation.
